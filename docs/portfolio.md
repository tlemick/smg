# Overview

1. First Section:
    {Username's} Portfolio should be an h1, followed by a stacked bar chart that shows users stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, over the course of the game.

    Below that a section that says "Since game start your portfolio has either gained/loss X in value"
    This section should have an empty state and a near empty state since the first week of the performance would make a weird chart.  Suggest something. 

2. Second section: S&P500 Comparison.
    A chart with two lines, the SP since game start compared to user's performance.
    Text below should show the percentage of under or over performance compared to the sp

3. Third section: Leader comparison
    A similar chart to 2. but with the leader's progress.

4. Portfolio allocation
    A set of bars that show an asset, and what percentage of the portfolio it represents.  So user can see that AAPL makes up 20% of their portfolio, etc.  It should be largest allocation to smallest.
